# 🏠 Housing Price Predictor using Linear Regression

This repository contains a beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts housing prices using **Linear Regression**, implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**. The goal is to provide a simple yet comprehensive introduction to regression-based predictive modeling.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we use a dataset containing features like square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and other housing details to predict the price of a house. The project walks through the complete machine learning pipeline, from loading and exploring the data to building and evaluating the model.

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Reading the dataset using pandas
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing relationships between variables
   - Identifying outliers

3. **Model Building**
   - Implementing Linear Regression using scikit-learn
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculating evaluation metrics:  
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)    
     - R² Score
   - Interpreting model performance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📒
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning)
